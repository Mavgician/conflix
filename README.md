## Welcome

This branch is a "To be maintained" version of the original ConFlix project where new features and revamps will be developed after the final project has been submitted, recorded, and graded.

# This will be treated as a practice repository for the developer.

## Requirements

This project assumes that the developer knows how to write JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap and knows how to use the React framework effectively.

```bash
NodeJS >= 10.5.0
Firebase CLI
```

## Getting Started

Install all the required packages first using:
```bash
npm install
or
yarn install
```

After packages are installed run `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
